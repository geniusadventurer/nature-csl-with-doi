# nature-csl-with-doi
For the default Nature csl file (see https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/blob/master/nature.csl), if a references contains volume number, then its doi will be hided automatically.
However, this is not the newest requirement of the editors from Nature (and its corresponding journals). This is what I met when I tried to revise my manuscript.
So this is it. I just deleted this condition to let all references with DOI show DOI.
Hope you will find it easy to use!
